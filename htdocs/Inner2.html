                <p>Inadequate sexual education perpetuates existing taboos and leads to probable impotence or lack of satisfaction, guilt complexes, and, in the absence of guidance, unexpected pregnancies and abortion. However, there are still some teenagers and adolescents that lack an understanding in 
                    sexual education, which can lead to them having one of the most common problem in teens: Teenage Pregnancy.</p>
        
                <p>Pregnancy between the ages of thirteen and nineteen is considered a teenage pregnancy. Similarly, there are females as young as ten years old who are sexually active or are sexually abused. As expected, an unexpected pregnancy may happen 
                and it would still be considered an adolescent pregnancy or teenage pregnancy.</p>

                    <p>Sex is considered ‘bastos’ or taboo in most places. With this, adolescents either don’t 
                        take Sex Ed seriously or refuse to learn about it. In some instances, when the topic is about Sex, 
                        some people seem to steer completely away from the topic because it feels ‘awkward’ or ‘bastos’. 
                        If this habit continues, teens and adolescents won’t be able to learn and continue to make mistakes. 
                        Furthermore, we will be talking about teenage pregnancy: one of the most common problems in teens.</p>
    
    
                    <p>Sexual intercourse, whether forced or consented to, is a primary cause of Teen Pregnancy. 
                        Some people may say, “Ginusto mo yan!” and blame it all on the victim. Don’t be too quick to judge 
                        or assume that the teen is just ‘malandi’ or uneducated, because the cause of their pregnancy may not 
                        be because they don't have any knowledge whatsoever sex. Instances like this happen because they don't 
                        know when they are being sexually assaulted; thus, young children and teenagers should be taught the 
                        difference between sexual abuse and affection, as in most cases, they can’t differentiate it. </p>
    
    
                    <p>Young individuals have the right to have a childhood and live healthy lives without trauma 
                        and negativity; Therefore, society must prepare them by offering comprehensive sexual health 
                        education that equips them with the tools they need to make healthy choices; Tools such as birth 
                        control pills and implants to prevent unwanted pregnancies.</p>

                    <p>Think about how dangerous it is to avoid discussing topics like this to young audiences. 
                        It could lead to so many things that could affect their whole life. Teen mothers should have
                        choices for themselves, and society should still respect those choices—the same society that
                         should have protected them from this kind of situation. However, respecting a young mother’s 
                         choice doesn’t mean that teenage pregnancy should be normalized. Unfortunately, 
                         it has come to the point where young individuals in social media ‘flex’ their baby bumps. 
                         A sad sight indeed that they think that pregnancy is a trend.</p>

                    <p>This author is not shaming the young mothers, but rather trying to relay a message. A message of awareness. </p>
